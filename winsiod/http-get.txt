NAME
       http-get - simple http client and siod example program

SYNOPSIS
       http-get  url [output-file] [:proxy=name] [:header=true] [:username=xx]
       [:password=xx] [:alarm=seconds] [:post=filename] [:cookie=value]  [:re‐
       direct=true] [:check-status=false] [:host=true]

DESCRIPTION
       http-get  is a simple http command-client which demonstrates the use of
       siod socket and regular expression capabilities.


   COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       :proxy=XXXXX
               The XXXXX is the name of the proxy server followed by  a  colon
               and a port number.

       :header=XXXXX
               The XXXXX if equal to true causes the http headers to be output
               along with the content. If equal to only causes only  the  http
               header to be output.

       :username=XXXXX
               The  XXXXXX  is the plain text username to transmit using basic
               authentication.

       :password=XXXXX
               The XXXXX is the plaintext password.

       :post=filename
               The filename contains lines of the form keyword=value. Both the
               keywords  and  values are url encoded, and the result is trans‐
               mitted to the web server as a POST  of  application/x-www-form-
               urlencoded content.

       :cookie=value
               A  cookie  header is included with the request. If the value is
               true then then the  set-cookie headers are used to  obtain  the
               cookie  value,  although  the  entire cookie spec is not imple‐
               mented. Otherwise value is used as  the  value  of  the  cookie
               header.


       :redirect=value
               If  value  is true (default) then redirections are handled by a
               recursive call to http-get.


       :check-status=false
               If value is true then before storing then an error exit  status
               is returned if the http response status is not of the form 2xx,
               in which case no content data is stored in the output file.


       :host=value
               If value is true (default)  then  an  http  1.1  style  "Host:"
               header  is  sent.   If  false  then none is sent. Otherwise the
               value specified is used as the host header.
