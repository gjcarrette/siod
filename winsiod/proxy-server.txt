NAME
       proxy-server - serializing, transaction logging http proxy server

SYNOPSIS
       proxy-server    [server-ip]   [server-port]   [:prefix=filename_prefix]
       [:overwrite=false] [:start=0]

DESCRIPTION
       proxy-server is a crude http proxy server which accepts one  connection
       at  a  time  and logs all information about the transaction between the
       client and server to a set of files containing a sequence number.

       The client request is logged to file type  req  the  responsed  headers
       from  the server are file type hdr and the content from the server to a
       file type which depends on the mime type of the result, txt  ,  html  ,
       gif  ,  jpg are supported, and the default for any unknown are unspeci‐
       fied type is dat

   COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       [server-ip]
               The server-ip defaults to 0.0.0.0.

       [server-port]
               The server-port defaults to 9000.

       :prefix=XXXX
               The XXXXX is the prefix used for the transaction log files.  It
               defaults  to  YEAR MONTH DAY HOUR MINUTE SECOND of the time the
               command was stated.

       :start=index
               The index plus 1 is the first filename created.

       :overwrite=status
               The status is false, the default, to prevent the  proxy  server
               from  overwriting  its  log files. A setting of true will allow
               files to be overwritten, and a setting of skip will  cause  the
               filename  counter  to  be  incremented  until  an  overwrite is
               avoided.


BUGS
       This utility isn't robust enough to run continuously as a proxy server.
       It  is intended to be run from the command line, to be monitored during
       use, and to be restarted manually if needed. You might see errors  mes‐
       sages such as empty request from client, accept (errobj Protocol error)
       and recv (errobj Connection reset by peer), from time to time,  depend‐
       ing on the client browser and tcp stack.
