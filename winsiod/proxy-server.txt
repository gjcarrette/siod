NAME
     proxy-server - serializing, transaction logging  http  proxy
     server

SYNOPSIS
     proxy-server            [server-ip]            [server-port]
     [:prefix=filename_prefix] [:overwrite=false] [:start=0]

DESCRIPTION
     proxy-server is a crude http proxy server which accepts  one
     connection  at  a  time  and  logs all information about the
     transaction between the client and server to a set of  files
     containing a sequence number.

     The client request is logged to file type req the  responsed
     headers  from  the  server are file type hdr and the content
     from the server to a file type which  depends  on  the  mime
     type  of  the  result, txt , html , gif , jpg are supported,
     and the default for any unknown are unspecified type is dat

  COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
     [server-ip]
             The server-ip defaults to 0.0.0.0.

     [server-port]
             The server-port defaults to 9000.

     :prefix=XXXX
             The XXXXX is the prefix used for the transaction log
             files.   It  defaults  to YEAR MONTH DAY HOUR MINUTE
             SECOND of the time the command was stated.

     :start=index
             The index plus 1 is the first filename created.

     :overwrite=status
             The status is false, the  default,  to  prevent  the
             proxy  server from overwriting its log files. A set-
             ting of true will allow files to be overwritten, and
             a setting of skip will cause the filename counter to
             be incremented until an overwrite is avoided.


BUGS
     This utility isn't robust enough to run  continuously  as  a
     proxy  server.  It  is  intended  to be run from the command
     line, to be monitored during use, and to be restarted  manu-
     ally  if needed. You might see errors messages such as empty
     request from client, accept (errobj Protocol error) and recv
     (errobj  Connection  reset  by  peer),  from  time  to time,
     depending on the client browser and tcp stack.
