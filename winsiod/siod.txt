NAME
       siod - small scheme interpreter (Scheme In One Defun).

SYNOPSIS
       siod  [-sX] [-hX] [-iX] [-gX] [-oX] [-nX] [-eX] [-vX] [-lX] [-mX] [-vX]
       [filenames]

DESCRIPTION
       Siod is a very small scheme interpreter which can be used for  interac‐
       tive  calculations,  scripts,  or  included as a command interpreter or
       extension/macro language in other applications. See  the  documentation
       for  interfacing  requirements  and how to add user-defined data types.
       The dash-style command line options may also be delimited by commas.


ARGUMENTS
       The arguments are files which are loaded from the current  or  SIOD_LIB
       directory,  by usual default /usr/local/lib/siod. Or the symbol repl to
       cause entry into the read-eval-print-loop, or parenthetical expressions
       to be evaluated.


   COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -hXXXXX The  XXXXX  should be an integer, specifying the number of cons
               cells to allocate in the heap. The default is 100000:10. Or  an
               integer  followed  by a colon, the number after which gives the
               maximum number of heaps to malloc with mark and sweep gc mode.

       -iXXXXX The XXXXX should be the name of an init  file  to  load  before
               going into the read/eval/print loop.

       -gX     The  X is 1 for a stop and copy garbage collector, 0 for a mark
               and sweep one (the default).

       -oXXXXX The XXXXX should be an integer,  specifying  the  size  of  the
               obarray  (symbol  hash  table)  to  use. Defaults to 1000. Each
               array element is a list of symbols.

       -nXXXXX The XXXXX should be an integer, specifying the number  of  pre-
               cons numbers to create. The default is 100.

       -sXXXXX The  XXXXX should be an integer, specifying the number of bytes
               of recursion on the machine (C-call frame) stack to allow. This
               may  be changed while the programming is running, and is mainly
               a  convenience  for  detecting  defects  in  programs.  Default
               200000.

       -eXXXXX The  XXXXX is an expression to evaluate (after loading the init
               file, if any).  After evaluating  the  expression  the  program
               will exit.

       -lXXXXX The  XXXXX is a library directory to use for the require proce‐
               dure.  defaults  to  the  environment  variable   SIOD_LIB   or
               /usr/local/lib/siod.

       -vXXXXX The  XXXXX  is an integer verboseness from 0 to 4. When used in
               scripts the most generally useful level is 0. Defaults to 4.

       -mXXXXX The XXXXX can be 0 (default) which has no effect, or  1,  which
               causes  the  scheme  procedure  main,  with  no arguments to be
               invoked after all files are loaded, or 2, which does  the  same
               thing but prevents further arguments from being interpreted, or
               3, which will wrap special error handling around  the  call  to
               main  which  is  convenient  for  writing cgi scripts producing
               html. The environment may be obtained from the getenv procedure
               or the variable *env*. Arguments are found in *args*.

       -vXXXXX The XXXXX Is passed along to the siod argument processing, how‐
               ever if the value is greater than 0 a Content-type:  text/plain
               header is generated immediately (except if the number is repre‐
               sented with a leading zero), which can be convenient for debug‐
               ging WWW cgi scripts. For example:

               #!/usr/local/bin/siod -v0,-m2
               (define (main)
                 (writes nil "Hello World0))

               Which if invoked normally will result in

               %hello.scm
               Hello World

               And with the verbose flag over-ride on the command line:


               %hello.scm -v5
               Content-type: text/plain

               10 heaps. size = 100000 cells, 2400000 bytes. 2048 inums. GC is mark and sweep
               loading hello.scm
               (define (main) (writes nil "Hello World
               "))
               done.
               Hello World
               EXIT


RETURN VALUE
       Errors during non-interactive usage mode result in a non-zero exit sta‐
       tus.


ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX
       Files which are loaded by the interpreter may contain the  sequence  of
       characters  parser:XXXXX  in  a  comment in the first line of the file.
       This will result in the automatic loading of the file  parser_XXXXX.scm
       which  must  provide  a procedure parser_XXXXX to return a procedure to
       read the forms from the file to  be  loaded.  Useful  values  of  XXXXX
       include read, pratt, and fasl.


FILES
       /usr/local/lib/siod/* /usr/local/lib/siod/siod.html /usr/local/lib/lib‐
       siod.so

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error  messages  may  also  set  the  variable  errobj to the offending
       object.

BUGS
       With -g1 it does not GC during EVAL, only before  each  READ/EVAL/PRINT
       cycle.   It  does  GC  during  EVAL with -g0, but that code may not run
       without modification on all architectures.
