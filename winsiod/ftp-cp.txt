NAME
       ftp-cp  -  copy files from from one place to another using passive mode
       ftp

SYNOPSIS
       ftp-cp host1 host2 script [:debug=true]

DESCRIPTION
       ftp-cp Loads the script file and then establishes ftp  control  connec‐
       tions  to  the  servers  at  host1 and host2. The values of environment
       variables hostX_USER and hostX_PASS are used  to  log  in  to  the  ftp
       servers, or the interactive user is prompted for input as required.

       The  script  file is loaded as lisp-format data, containing expressions
       that indicate file transfers, or that evaluate to a list of file trans‐
       fer specifications, for example:

       ("filename1" -> "filename2")
       ("filename1" <- "filename2")
       (mapcar (lambda (x)
                 (list (string-append "/home/gjc/ftp/" x)
                       '->
                       (string-append "/usr/users/gjc/ftp/" x)))
               '(data.1 data.2 data.3))


EXIT STATUS
       Errors result in a non-zero exit status.
