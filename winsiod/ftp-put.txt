FTP-PUT(1)                  General Commands Manual                 FTP-PUT(1)



NAME
       ftp-put - copy files from local host to remote using passive mode ftp

SYNOPSIS
       ftp-put   LocalFilename   RemoteHost   [RemoteFilename]   [:debug=true]
       [:buff=2048] [:rename=true]

DESCRIPTION
       ftp-put Opens a connection to the ftp server  on  the  RemoteHost,  and
       puts, using ftp passive mode, the LocalFilename to a temporary filename
       constructed from the RemoteFilename.  When the data  transfer  is  com‚Äê
       plete  a  RENAME  operation  is  issued.  Therefore  the RemoteFilename
       appears atomically. This is very important when uploading files  to  an
       area  from  which other ftp and http processes are actively serving. If
       :rename=false then the file is stored directly without renaming.

       Username and password may  be  picked  up  from  environment  variables
       (RemoteHost_USER and RemoteHost_PASS) or the user is prompted.

       If LocalFilename is . (dot) then the data is read from standard input.


EXIT STATUS
       Errors result in a non-zero exit status.

BUGS
       The password is received using the built-in unix getpass, which on some
       systems  (Solaris)  truncates  the  user input to 8 characters.  If the
       remote system can handle longer passwords then this is a problem.
