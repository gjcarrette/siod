SNAPSHOT-COMPARE(1)         General Commands Manual        SNAPSHOT-COMPARE(1)



NAME
       snapshot-compare - compare two snapshots of a directory tree

SYNOPSIS
       snapshot-compare   <snapshot-1>   <snapshot-2>  [:strip=N]  [:strip1=N]
       [:strip2=N]


DESCRIPTION
       snapshot-compare

       will load the two directory  snapshot  databases,  strip  a  number  of
       slashes from the pathnames of the files in the databases, then generate
       a report describing files which are in one snapshot but not the  other,
       and  also  what  files which have different MD5 checksums between snap‐
       shots.

       The following example shows that the file foo.bar is  contained  exclu‐
       sively in the x.after snapshot, and the snapshot-compare.1 file is dif‐
       ferent between snapshots.

       bosa00> ./snapshot-compare x.before x.after
       ; loading x.before
       ; done 227 files
       ; loading x.after
       ; done 229 files
       ; x.after /moby/src/kit/foo.bar
       diff /moby/src/kit/snapshot-compare.1

       The effect of the strip parameter is demonstrated in this example:

       bosa00> ./snapshot-compare x.before x.after :strip=3
       ; loading x.before
       ; done 227 files
       ; loading x.after
       ; done 229 files
       ; strip 3 levels of / from x.before
       ; strip 3 levels of / from x.after
       ; x.after kit/foo.bar
       diff kit/snapshot-compare.1


EXIT STATUS
       Errors result in a non-zero exit status.
