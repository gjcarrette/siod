CSIOD(1)                    General Commands Manual                   CSIOD(1)



NAME
       csiod - a compiler/linker for siod

SYNOPSIS
       csiod  [:o=outfile]  [:m=flag]  [:v=flag] [:i=val] [:p=fasl] [:e=false]
       [:b=bootstrap.exe]
                infile ...

DESCRIPTION
       csiod Creates the outfile, default a.out, by loading  all  the  expres‐
       sions  from the input files, and then saving the result in fast-loading
       format. A "#! interpreter-name" style header is written to  the  output
       file using information from the optional flag arguments.

       In  non-unix  environments, which lack the "#!" convention, alternative
       techniques are used. Under WIN32 and VMS a bootstrap-exe file  is  uti‐
       lized.


   COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       :m=flag The  flag  defaults  to  2,  causing  the  procedure main to be
               invoked. Use a value of 3 for cgi scripts.

       :v=flag The flag defaults to "01" causing  errors  to  be  reported.  A
               value of "0" supresses error messages, higher values cause more
               messages.  Use a value of "1" or "0" for cgi scripts.

       :i=val  The val defaults to whatever was used in the compilation of the
               csiod command itself, which is /usr/local/bin/siod by default.

       :p=parser
               The  parser  can be fasl or read and controls the output format
               of the data of the compiler. The  read  format  data  is  human
               readable,  the  fasl  format  data is binary and in cases where
               there are many references to the same symbol name is more  com‐
               pact and faster to load.


       :e=evalflag
               The  evalflag  defaults  to false, if true then each file being
               compiled is loaded with  regular  evaluation  semantics  first,
               then  loaded  again  to obtain forms for compilation. Currently
               this sort of thing matters only for  uses  of  #.read-time-eval
               but  would  be  important  if  the  compiler was extended to do
               macroexpansions or other optimizations.


       :b=bootstrap
               The bootstrap is the name of an executable file,  the  contents
               of  which  are used instead of the #!interpreter magic from the
               :i=flag when the output filename ends in exe. This trick  tends
               to work in all operating systems, including unix variations.
